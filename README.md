# opentransportdata

A curated list of open transport datasets for research, teaching, and to save the world 🚲🚶🚀

If you know of any other useful datasets / resources to help with these things, please put in a [PR](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/opentransportdata/edit/master/README.md).

Each addition must come with a description that explains how it's useful.
The aim is to highlight high quality datasets rather than breadth.

## Lists

- https://data.world/datasets/transportation which lists a variety of 3000+ seemingly mostly open datasets

- https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data which links to an open dataset on road crashes in the UK. A large (1.6m points) sample of these can be accessed with `dl_stats19()` function from the stplanr R package (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html) for details).
