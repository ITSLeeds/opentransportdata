# opentransportdata

A curated list of open transport datasets for research, teaching, and to save the world ðŸš²ðŸš¶ðŸš€

If you know of any other useful datasets / resources to help with these things, please put in a [PR](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/opentransportdata/edit/master/README.md).

Each addition must come with a description that explains how it's useful.
The aim is to highlight high quality datasets rather than breadth.
